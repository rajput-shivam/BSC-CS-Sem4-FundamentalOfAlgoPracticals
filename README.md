# BSC-CS-Sem4-FundamentalOfAlgoPracticals

These have all the practicals performed by me in semester 4 for the module Fundamentals Of Algorithm<br/>
All these practicals are performed in python but no inbuilt libraries have been used, hence these codes can be converted to java or C or to any other programming language.
<br/><br/>
All the practicals performed: <br/><br/> 
bfs<br/>
dfs<br/>
binary search tree<br/>
merge sort<br/>
quick sort<br/>
partition algo<br/>
Tournament algo<br/>
Huffman Encoding<br/><br/>
Kudos;)
