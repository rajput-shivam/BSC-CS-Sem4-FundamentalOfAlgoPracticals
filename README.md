# BSC-CS-Sem4-FundamentalOfAlgoPracticals

These have all the practicals performed by me in semester 4 for the module Fundamentals Of Algorithm
All these practicals are performed in python but no inbuilt libraries have been used, hence these codes can be converted to java or C or to any other programming language.

All the practicals performed:

bfs
dfs
binary search tree
merge sort
quick sort
partition algo
Tournament algo
Huffman Encoding
Kudos;)
